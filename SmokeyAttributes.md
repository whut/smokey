## Introduction ##

You may define and then use custom attributes within your assembly to affect the way Smokey processes your code. Currently Smokey only checks for DisableRuleAttribute, but the next version of Smokey will likely check for additional attributes.


## Attributes ##

  * DisableRuleAttribute is used to disable a particular Smokey rule for a type or method.
